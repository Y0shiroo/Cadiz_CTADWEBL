<p>Say hello to the latest member of the Porsche Sportmade family – the Porsche External icon911 GT3 RS. An athlete both on and off the track, this all-new aerodynamic wonder follows its 2013 predecessor – the 911 GT3 RS (Type 991 II) – and is presented in a more radical form than ever before, thanks to its lightweight construction and incredible attention to detail. Never before has Porsche put such levels of effort into the development of one of its Porsche GT sportscars.</p>
